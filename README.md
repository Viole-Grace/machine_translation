# Machine translation
A neural machine translation, part of a bot capability.

# Neural Translation :

- Ability to translate sentences / speech from one language to another taking into account context and literal meanings. This makes the network aware towards common linguistic niches that might otherwise not be caught. A similar translation architecture is used by Google Translate, and has been the key towards machine translation techniques in NLP and AI.

# Network Architecture :

I have used a simple encoder network based on LSTM units. Alternately, GRUs can be used and networks can be made mulitple layers deeper to get more feature encoding.
